# Boids

This is a student project for the Complex Systems course.  
We had to make a fun application using boids.

## Rules

The game starts with two teams, Red team vs Blue team.  
Each team is made of five ghosts that will hunt down pumpkins.  
Once boids have collected around five candies they will go back to their side of the screen to goal the collected pumpkins.  
Each boid respond to a flock system meaning they won't split on their own, but they can if a boid saw a pumpkin away from the flock.  

## Controls

This is mainly a contemplative game, but you can still interact with the ghosts :  
- Left click : spawns a pumpkin at the mouse position.  
- Right click (hold) : spawns a candy that will attract every ghosts.

Happy Halloween !
